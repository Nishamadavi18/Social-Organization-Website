            <p>Seventy-year-old J D Khurana and his wife, who founded the government approved NGO, ‘Guru Nanak Sewa Sansthan’ say that it pained them to see young children work as domestic servants and rag-pickers at an age when they should be going to schools and thus took upon themselves the responsibility of building them a bright future.The school, which initially started with four children in the parking area of Ardee City has now grown into a full-fledged institution, where classes from pre-nursery to the ninth grade are held in makeshift tents.“We provide books, textbooks, mid-day meals and a winter and summer uniform free of cost.</p>

            <h3>‘Zero Food Children’ Report: Despite Govt Criticism, the Study Is Important</h3>
            <p>The study, if one were to actually read it, is a straightforward one and makes its entire content abundantly clear in the abstract itself.Those of us who have been working diligently on issues related to nutrition in India for decades have become used to, in recent times, a certain unhelpful reaction from the government to denounce malnutrition data and pronounce it as malicious, or as an attempt to tarnish the image of the country.To be fair, the rhetoric related to the data found in the press and media from the government or its political opposition is often neither balanced nor technically correct, though many of us attempt to present a more rational, reasoned and careful response.</p>

            <p>For 13-year-old Julia Mone, assisting mentally challenged kids at NGO Aavhan, Mahim, meant effective utilisation of her summer holidays, whereas for Vedant R (17), organising personality development camps and forming word building quizzes at Vedant Welfare Foundation (VWF) will help him be a better person.Coming out of their comfort zones to help the needy and knowing more about the neighbourhood is what defines the coming summer holidays for these children. With schools and NGOs encouraging such behaviour and calling for volunteers to assist them at social work, students have discovered new interests in spending time with under-privileged kids who may require a helping hand.“By going to such places, school kids are sensitised towards the need of these children from different backgrounds. They develop empathy and also will be able to help them,” said Lata Balaji, a teacher at Cathedral and John Connon School for the past 10 years and also the trip organiser. </p>

            <h3>Social Work education in India 2024</h3>
            <p>Social work education in India is a dynamic field that equips individuals with the skills to address diverse social issues and contribute to community well-being. The curriculum focuses on imparting crucial skills such as empathy, effective communication, and cultural sensitivity, recognizing the importance of understanding India’s diverse cultural landscape.

               However, challenges exist, including outdated syllabi that may not align with current societal realities and the evolving nature of social work. Bridging the gap between academic training and practical skills remains a challenge, impacting the immediate employability of graduates. Despite these challenges, social work education presents numerous opportunities for students to make meaningful contributions to society.The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 introduces reforms that emphasize holistic education, creating a demand for professionally trained social workers to shape the future of education in India.</p>
